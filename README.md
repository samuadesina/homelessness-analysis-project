# Homelessness Data Analysis
# Homelessness Data Analysis

This project explores and visualizes homelessness data across US states and regions using Python, pandas, and matplotlib. The analysis provides insights into the scale and distribution of homelessness, focusing on both individuals and family members, and examines trends at the state and regional levels.

## Key Features

- **Total homelessness by state and region:**  
  Identify which states and regions have the highest and lowest numbers of homeless individuals and families.

- **Homelessness rate per 10,000 people:**  
  Calculate and visualize the rate of homelessness relative to state and regional populations.

- **Comparison between individuals and family members:**  
  Analyze the proportion of family homelessness in each state.

- **Regional trends:**  
  Discover which regions have consistently higher or lower homelessness rates.

- **Top and bottom states:**  
  Highlight the states with the highest and lowest homelessness rates per 10,000 people.

## Visualizations

The project includes bar charts for:
- Total homeless individuals by region
- Top 10 states by total homeless individuals
- Top and bottom 5 states by homelessness rate per 10,000 people
- Proportion of family homelessness by state
- Homelessness rate per 10,000 people by region

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your `homelessness.csv` data file in the project folder.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```
4. Run the analysis script:
   ```
   python python_corse.py
   ```
